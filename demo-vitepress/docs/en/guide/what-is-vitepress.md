# What is VitePress?

VitePress is a Static Site Generator (SSG) designed for building fast, content-centric websites. In a nutshell, VitePress takes your source content written in Markdown, applies a theme to it, and generates static HTML pages that can be easily deployed anywhere.
## Use Cases

### Title <Badge type="info" text="default" />
### Title <Badge type="tip" text="^1.9.0" />
### Title <Badge type="warning" text="beta" />
### Title <Badge type="danger" text="caution" />

VitePress provides Syntax Highlighting powered by [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki), with additional features like line-highlighting:

**Input**

````md
```js{4}
export default {
  data () {
    return {
      msg: 'Highlighted!'
    }
  }
}
```
````

**Output**

```js{4}
export default {
  data () {
    return {
      msg: 'Highlighted!'
    }
  }
}
```
