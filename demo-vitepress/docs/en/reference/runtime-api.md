# Runtime API

VitePress offers several built-in APIs to let you access app data. VitePress also comes with a few built-in components that can be used globally.

The helper methods are globally importable from vitepress and are typically used in custom theme Vue components. However, they are also usable inside .md pages because markdown files are compiled into Vue Single-File Components.

## Syntax Highlighting

### Title <Badge type="info" text="default" />
### Title <Badge type="tip" text="^1.9.0" />
### Title <Badge type="warning" text="beta" />
### Title <Badge type="danger" text="caution" />

VitePress provides Syntax Highlighting powered by [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki), with additional features like line-highlighting:

**Input**

````md
```js{4}
export default {
  data () {
    return {
      msg: 'Highlighted!'
    }
  }
}
```
````

**Output**

```js{4}
export default {
  data () {
    return {
      msg: 'Highlighted!'
    }
  }
}
```
